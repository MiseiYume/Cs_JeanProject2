## General info

Simple project made to get a minimum experience in C# and it's functions.
Program's handling cases with a proper input (integrals) and incorrect ones like letters, double type numerals etc.
The code itself is mostly based on loops, parsing, recursive use of methods, and has a built in stopwatch. (I was curious if there will be any difference in performance. Apparently not in such a small program.)

## Technologies 

The program is based on:
* .NET Core 3.1
* C# 8.0

## Executing

To launch this code you'll need a C# compilator in order to compile it i.e. in your IDE or to create an .exe file.
